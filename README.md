### What is this?
A (computer) keyboard-centric music transcription app specifically targeting Bagpipe music

### What *ISN'T* this?
* A pipe band scoring tool (single instrument / single voice only, i.e. no drums, no multi-part harmonies)
* A music engraving tool (minimal style adjustment and layout configuration options -- export a `.musicxml` file and use something like [MuseScore](https://musescore.org/en) instead)
* A general purpose music editor

### Project goals
* Performance (quick to load, pleasant to use)
* Keyboard-first (allow a 100%-keyboard-based workflow)


### ...and non-goals
* Anything to do with collaboration or sharing
* Audio playback

### Why would I use this
* It's easy to learn and easy to use
* It's laser-focused on Bagpipe music (notes/embelleshments/key signatures/etc)
* It's free

The intended workflow is to use this app to generate basic notation, export to a common interchange format (e.g. musicXML), and open that with a separate app for playback/layout or styling adjustments/etc.
